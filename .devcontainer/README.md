# Devcontainer

How credentials reach this container, what survives a rebuild, and what deploy tooling can do
from inside it. For getting the app running, see [GETTING_STARTED.md](../GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Host requirements

- **Docker** with Compose **2.24 or later** — the optional `env_file` entries need it.
- **VS Code** with the **Dev Containers** extension.
- **`gh` logged in on the host** — optional, recommended. Without it `gh` inside the container
  starts logged out after every rebuild.
- **An SSH agent with your key loaded** — only for deploy tooling and server access. `ssh-add -l`
  on the host should list it.

## What the container inherits

| Credential | How it arrives | Survives a rebuild? |
|---|---|---|
| `git push` / `git pull` over SSH | VS Code forwards the host's SSH agent (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) | Yes |
| SSH to your server (Kamal, `bin/prod-sync`) | The same forwarded agent | Yes |
| `gh` CLI | `initialize.sh` runs `gh auth token` on the host into `.host.env` → `GH_TOKEN` | Yes |
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER`, `GITHUB_ACTOR` | `initialize.sh` derives them from the `origin` remote | Yes |
| Git author name and email | VS Code copies the host's `~/.gitconfig` | Yes |
| `HOST_IP`, `APP_HOST` | `local.env`, which you write | Yes |
| Claude Code or any other tool's login | Not inherited — it lives in the container layer | **No** |
| Production secrets | Not inherited, by design — they live in the GitHub Environment | **No** |

`initializeCommand` runs `initialize.sh` **on the host** before every start. It writes
`.devcontainer/.host.env` (mode 600, gitignored) and always exits 0, so a host without `gh` or
`git` still opens the container. Compose loads `.host.env` and then `local.env` as environment
files; both are optional, and a variable set in `local.env` wins.

Environment files are read when the container is **created**. Reopening an existing container
keeps the old values; **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container** picks up new ones.

## First open

1. On the host, optionally: `gh auth login`, and `ssh-add` your key.
2. Only if you will use deploy tooling, before opening:
   ```bash
   cp .devcontainer/local.env.example .devcontainer/local.env
   $EDITOR .devcontainer/local.env    # HOST_IP and APP_HOST
   ```
   Doing this after the container exists works too, followed by a rebuild.
3. Open the folder in VS Code and run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**. `post-create.sh`
   prepares the databases on first creation.
4. Check, in a container terminal:
   ```bash
   gh auth status          # "Logged in … (GH_TOKEN)" when the host was logged in
   env | grep ^GITHUB_     # the three derived values
   ```

## Deploy tooling from the container

`config/deploy.yml` renders from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, `GITHUB_ACTOR`, `HOST_IP` and `APP_HOST`, and
every one of them is in the environment. Commands that only read, or that run inside a container
already up on the server, need no secret:

```bash
bin/kamal config                      # resolved config — check it before anything else
bin/kamal app details                 # running containers, image, uptime
bin/kamal accessory details postgres
bin/kamal app logs -r job -n 200
bin/kamal audit
bin/kamal console                     # also: shell, db, logs
bin/kamal app exec --reuse --roles web 'bin/rails about'
bin/prod-sync status
```

**Why the aliases use `--reuse`.** Without it Kamal starts a fresh container, and that begins with
a registry login on the server — `KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`, which exists only in CI. With
`--reuse --interactive` Kamal runs `docker exec` over SSH into the running container and never
logs in (`Kamal::Cli::App#exec`, Kamal 2.12). Confirmed with `bin/kamal console` from a rebuilt
container; `shell` passes the same flags to the same command.

**To verify:** `bin/kamal db` goes through `accessory exec --reuse --interactive`, a different
command path that has not been run from a container yet.

**What does not work here**, and must not be forced: `deploy`, `redeploy`, `rollback`, `setup`,
`build`, `app boot`, and `app exec` without `--reuse`. They push an image, need the registry, or
write the container's env file from `.kamal/secrets` — which in this container resolves every
secret to an empty string, silently. Run them through GitHub Actions (`deploy.yml`), or from the
host with the secrets exported, per [docs/ops/deploy.md](../docs/ops/deploy.md).

## Security model

- **The token carries every scope of the host's `gh` login** — usually `repo`, `read:org` and
  `gist` — not a scope chosen for this container.
- **It sits in the container's environment**, readable by every process in it (extensions,
  AI agents, `docker inspect` on the host), and **in plain text in `.host.env`** on disk. The file
  is gitignored and excluded from the image build context by `.dockerignore`.
- **This is no worse than `gh auth login` inside the container**, which writes a token in plain
  text to `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`, since there is no keyring to hold it. The difference: it is
  the host's own token, so revoking it logs the host out too.
- **To narrow it**, put a fine-grained personal access token scoped to this repository in
  `local.env` as `GH_TOKEN`. It overrides the inherited one in the environment; `.host.env` is
  still written.
- **Without `gh` on the host**, `GH_TOKEN` is simply absent. `gh auth login` inside the container
  works until the next rebuild.
- **On Windows**, `initializeCommand` runs under `cmd.exe`. With Git for Windows' `sh` on the
  `PATH` it behaves as above; without it the command falls through, no `.host.env` is written,
  and the `GITHUB_*` values have to go in `local.env`. Untested on Windows. Under WSL it is Linux,
  and needs `gh` installed inside WSL.
- **In Codespaces** the script runs in the cloud host and finds no `gh` login there; Codespaces
  provides its own `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Kamal aborts with `GITHUB_REPOSITORY is not set` (or `GITHUB_ACTOR`) | The variable is not in the environment: no `origin` remote, `initialize.sh` did not run, or the container predates it | On the host, `cat .devcontainer/.host.env`; then **Rebuild Container** |
| Kamal aborts with `HOST_IP is not set` or `key not found: "APP_HOST"` | No `local.env`, or the container predates it | Create it from `local.env.example`, then **Rebuild Container** |
| `gh` asks you to log in | The host's `gh` is not logged in, is not on the `PATH` VS Code starts with, or was logged in after the container was created | `gh auth status` on the host, then **Rebuild Container** |
| An edit to `local.env` has no effect | Environment files are read at creation; reopening does not recreate | **Rebuild Container** |
| `ssh-add -l` says it cannot connect to the agent, or SSH fails with `Permission denied (publickey)` | The agent is forwarded only to processes VS Code starts; `docker exec` and outside terminals have no `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, and the host agent may hold no key | Use a VS Code terminal; on the host, `ssh-add` your key |
